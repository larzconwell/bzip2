bzip2

[GoDoc](http://godoc.org/github.com/larzconwell/bzip2)

Package bzip2 implements access to compress and decompress data in the bzip2 format.

Currently this focuses on the compressor since [compress/bzip2](http://golang.org/pkg/compress/bzip2) doesn't include one.

Hopefully this will be eventually merged into the standard library without any changes on the users part.
